# MAT-INF1100 – Modelling and computations

# Course content

MAT-INF1100 is a first semester course in mathematics that unites classical and computational perspectives on mathematics. Thematically the course is focused on deriving numerical methods for computing quantities like the derivative, the integral and approximate solutions of various kinds of equations. Taylors formula with remainder and basic properties of numbers, including how they are represented in a computer, are also important topics which in this course are used to analyse the errors and limitations of the computational methods.

MAT-INF1100 is closely linked to MAT1100 – Calculus and IN1900 – Introduction to Programming with Scientific Applications. The teaching in the course assumes that the students are able to program a computer. This competence must either be learnt before they attend MAT-INF1100 or while attending the course.
