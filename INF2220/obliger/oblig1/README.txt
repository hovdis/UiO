1. swap()       -> O(n)
   replace()    -> O(n)
   addRand()    -> O(n^2)
   removeRand() -> O(n^2)

I have not added the time the method searchWord or buildt in methods uses(new String).
Since going through the alphabet uses constant time, I have not added that either.

2. javac *.java

3. Main.java contains the main

4. Assumptions: the user only inputs one word at a time. I also assume that a word never needs to be deleted.

5. Peculiarities:

6. I have not implemented delete node. If I had done that, the depth and "nodes per depth" would be wrong,
    and I would have to implement other methods for keeping track of depth.

7. I don't have any preferences on the feedback language, write what you are most comfortable with.
    I would like feedback on anything you feel is worth saying. Maybe comments on where i put methods etc.?

8. I have worked a lot in the room Euclid, and when I was stuck, there was always someone who could help me out.
