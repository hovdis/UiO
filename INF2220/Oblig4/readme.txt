1. An explanation of your algorithm and why it works. Use common sense
there, for instance, a lengthy repetition of the principles of Boyer-MooreHorspool
etc is not needed/wished. Concentrate on your solution and
highlight, if it helps understanding, special points of the code.
- The program is a little less effective when the program has to take into account wildcards. The reason is that the needle is moved x places, where x is the index of the first wildcard instead of the length of the needle.

2. How to compile your program (ie. javac *.java)
- javac *.java

3. Which file includes the main-method
- Oblig4.java

4. Any assumptions you have made when implementing the assignment
-

5. Any peculiarities about your implementation
- 

6. The status of your delivery (what works and what does not)
- Done. Everything I have tested works

7. Give credit if your code is heavily influenced by some source (ie. teaching material)
- Had a little help from a student to just understand the concept of the BM-algorithm because I was not in the lecture.
