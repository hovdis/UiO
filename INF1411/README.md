# INF1411 â€“ Electronic systems

# Course content

This course aims at giving an introduction to  electronic systems work and is relevant for those who wish to learn basic electronic principles. Understanding how electronic circuits function and can de designed are important topics, and both active and passive circuit elements will be addressed. Through lab exercises and analytical methods, students will  learn how electronic systems work and how they may be used in practical applications. Examples will illustrate how analogue signals can be used to measure and control natural porcesses such as light sensors and temperature measurement devices. The design principles taught in this course are also relevant for understanding, analyzing and designing digital systems.

# Learning outcome

The course gives an introductin to design of electric circuits and analysis methods. Construction principles based on Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws will be elaborated and supplemented with time and frequency domain analysis and construction techniques. Both lab execrises and conventional problem solving techniques are used to demonstrate the various methods in practice. The students will also acquire basic knowledge in using simple measurement instruments.
