# IN5320 - Development in Platform Ecosystems

In this course, we learned the basics within front-end development, as well as work in a small team to develop a web application with react.
As of right now, I dont have the finished project just yet (need to track down the person who has the code now), so the only things in here are the two manditory assignments we did before the main project.

### Course content

In this course, you will learn the principles and practice of application design and development within platform ecosystems. Conceptually, you will learn about the socio-technical complexities related to large-scale information systems, and how platform architectures and ecosystems attempt to address these. Further, we look at how such architectures may enable user participation in the development of applications and user interfaces that are sensitive to local requirements within a larger system. As a part of this, principles of open source software development, web development, REST architectures, APIs and software platforms will be emphasized. Practically, you will develop web applications with JavaScript and HTML using modern, open-source frameworks and RESTful APIs with an emphasis on requirements derived from user needs.

The practical work is based on individual assignments and a major group project. For the individual assignments, you will practice developing applications in JavaScript that utilize RESTful web APIs. For the group project, you will together with other students develop a web application with JavaScript and HTML using the RESTful web API of the open source platform DHIS2 (www.dhis2.org). Developed at the Department of Informatics, DHIS2 is the most widely used health management information system in the world. The group projects are based on real-world use-cases and needs from DHIS2 users around the world.
